#### _**Project Topic:**_
>_“E-commerce website to sell second hand product; Bidding system for AIT.”_

It's idea is like any e-commerce platform in which buying and selling of goods are done. But the core addition will be the system of bidding before buying anything.The products added will be subjected to certain time frame where users most probably buyers will be allowed to bid on their products and are able to buy the product once the bid time closes or when there are no other bidders. 
In case of AIT, this platform can be used to sell the used items. More than one person could be interested in the same product, but with this system, there will be a sense of competition as one person bids over another user’s bid at the same time and the product value will also increase.
